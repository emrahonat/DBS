An Analysis of Doppler Beam Sharpening Technique Used in Fighter Aircraft


Abstract:
---------
In this paper, Doppler beam sharpening, which is a frequently used imaging method in fighter aircraft, is explained. Within the technological development process this field is used in Real Beam Ground Mapping, Doppler Beam Sharpening and Synthetic Aperture Radar respectively. In this report, the theoretical background of Doppler beam sharpening technique is presented and modeling for the simulation environment has been studied.
